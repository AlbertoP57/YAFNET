If you are upgrading from an earlier version, make sure you have a
backup of your existing database and files. At the minimum make sure
you don't overwrite your Web.config file. The existing Web.config
should work, but you might want to compare it with the new default.config to
see what has been added or removed. After upgrading you should
open install/default.aspx and your database should be automatically
updated.

1. Unzip to a folder available from your web server.

2. Rename development.config or release.config (which one depends on whether
   you are setting production or testing web) to web.config. If you are merging
   YAF to your web application, make sure to merge one of those configs with
   web.config file.

   Modify the "db.config" file:

   Modify the yafnet connectionString property to use your database. 
   The database can be an already existing database, or you can 
   create a new database to install to.

   Modify "app.config" file:

   Modify the boardid to the boardid that you wish to view.  If you 
   only have one board or don't know what this is, leave it alone.

   Modify "mail.config" file:

   Modify the smtp settings by entering your mail server information.

   Warning: DO NOT touch the web.config unless you know what you're doing.

3. If YetAnotherForum.net isn't installed at the root of your web
   server, make sure the files in the bin directory of the zip file
   is copied to /bin on your web server. Also you'll need to add the
   "root" key to the appSettings (in app.config) to point to the correct URL.
   Example: If you have install the forum in the directory "/forum/yaf/"
   you will need to add key with name "root" and value "/forum/yaf/" 
   to app.config.

4. Open the file <YAFroot>install/default.aspx on your web site. If you
   are testing on your local computer, under a directory called
   YetAnotherForum.Net, the address should be:
   http://localhost/yetanotherforum.net/install/

5. Follow the directions and log in with the administration account
   you created during the setup.
   
6. Give the ASPNET/Network Service account write access to the Upload
   folder.

7. When running in production environment, make sure to disable debugging
   in web.config and turn custom error on. You can just rename release.config
   to web.config to achieve this effect. Similarly, use development.config file
   to disable custom errors and enable debugging.
