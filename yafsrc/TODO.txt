- upload/attach files
- Remove unvalidated people after 24 hours
- Approved users don't have to be moderated
- Is there currently a way to display a welcome message / header 
  specific to certain groups? For instance, I would like to display 
  a message to all Guests encouraging them to register on the site, 
  however, I do not want this message visible to Members or Administrators.
- It would be nice to have a Popup + Web + EMail notification for Personal 
  Messages + an option in the Profile to disable it.
- option to mark topic or forum as read.
- tooltips for "last post" icon, and user profile links (Goto last post, View profile).
- inserting smilies: http://forum.yetanotherforum.net/posts.aspx?t=155
- allow admin to pm all members. admin function to delete old pm's
