- Remove unvalidated people after 24 hours
- Approved users don't have to be moderated
- Is there currently a way to display a welcome message / header 
  specific to certain groups? For instance, I would like to display 
  a message to all Guests encouraging them to register on the site, 
  however, I do not want this message visible to Members or Administrators.
- It would be nice to have a Popup + Web + EMail notification for Personal 
  Messages + an option in the Profile to disable it.
- option to mark topic or forum as read.
- tooltips for user profile links (View profile).
- allow admin to pm all members.
- visual clues on rich edit buttons.
- somehow show that there are messages to be moderated.
- Keep deleted posts for later purge. Option for moderators to tell why the post was deleted.
- Admin can change user password
- Language strings: tooltips for buttons (reply, quote, ...)

- Create example category/forum/message on first install
