1. Unzip yafdnn3-v10RC1.zip to your DotNetNuke directory.
2. Modify "Web.config.dotnetnuke" to point to the yafnet database, and "merge" it
   with "DotNetNuke/Web.config".
3. Go to your DotNetNuke site and add Yet Another Forum.net as a new module definition
   and insert the module like you would any other module. Please note that there are
